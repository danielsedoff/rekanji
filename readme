rekanji

rekanji is a site for Japanese language learners. You see a random list of kanji. Do you remember this character? Check yourself by tapping it. Register to access all kanji. There are no ads or spam here.

This site is written in PHP and Javascript. It uses php mail sending routines to facilitate email registration.

Before programming this site I spent quite a while compiling one-word dictionaries for Japanese characters both in Russian and in English.

Special thanks to Jim Breen for his EDICT!
